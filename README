James Capuder, I worked alone.
I affirm that I have adhered to the honor code in this assignment.

All "looping, forking, piping" components are indeed functional, as well as multipiping and SIGINT, and rediction, but not background (ran out of time).

I'm unaware of bugs or errors, but haven't tested as extensively as I'd like.

The only design decision I have to share is the motivation behind the name: Made-Up-SHell.
